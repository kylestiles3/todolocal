This project must be optimized for immediate deployment on Vercel and future monetization (e.g., Google AdSense). Here are the requirements:

1. Stack & Environment

Use React + Vite for the front-end and Express + Node for the back-end API.

Use TypeScript across all layers.

Organize code so that Vercel can detect both the server (API) and client (React) correctly.

Ensure static assets (images, favicon) are in a public folder that Vercel can serve directly.

2. Directory Features

Homepage listing events with tabs or filters: "This Week", "This Weekend", "Free Events".

Event detail pages with description, date/time, location, and optional images.

Clean, responsive UI with navigation component.

Include placeholder ad slots for AdSense in the layout.

Ability to add more events dynamically via API or local JSON/DB.

3. Full-Stack Separation

/client/src → React app

/server → Express API with routes for fetching events

/shared → Common schemas/types/interfaces for events

/public → Static assets (favicon, images, etc.)

Keep build outputs and configuration clean so Vercel can deploy without errors.

4. Data & State Management

Use React Query or similar for fetching events from API.

Include hooks for common functionality like fetching events and handling loading/errors.

5. Deployment Optimizations

Ensure Vercel can detect client build (vite build) and server API (server/index.ts) automatically.

Include vercel.json for build settings if needed.

Ensure public path for static assets works correctly.

6. Code Quality & Structure

Use TypeScript and interfaces for all event objects.

Cleanly separate components (UI, navigation, cards, layout).

Avoid legacy or duplicated code.

Ensure all imports use proper paths for Replit and Vercel.

7. Bonus Features (if simple enough)

SEO meta tags for each page

Mobile-friendly layout

Optional: “Add Event” form (can be local JSON only for MVP)

Optional: placeholder for user accounts or admin in future

Final Deliverables

Fully working Replit project with the above structure.

Should run on Replit preview exactly like it would on Vercel.

Everything up-to-date for 12/30/25 standards, TypeScript 5+, React 18+, Vite latest.

Clean separation of client/server/shared/public for maintainability and future feature expansion.

Important Notes for Vercel

Server API Detection: Ensure the server/index.ts (or server.ts) is listed as the server entry point. Vercel will auto-detect if under /api or /server.

Client Build Output: vite build should output to dist/public or whatever is set in vite.config.ts, and vercel.json should point to it.

Static Assets: Everything in /public is automatically served.

AdSense: Insert <script> or <ins> placeholders in App.tsx or a layout component for easy monetization.

If you like, the next step is to execute this prompt in Replit, so we can generate a fully clean, deployable, AdSense-ready directory website, then I can walk you through pushing it to GitHub and connecting to Vercel without the weird download issues.

Do you want me to prepare the exact Replit-ready version of this prompt next so you can copy-paste it?
